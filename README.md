A link to invite the bot to a Discord server will be provided when I feel like it's ready for public use.
# Capperbot (WIP)
A Discord bot with server moderation tools and various entertaining commands.

It is written in JavaScript, utilizing the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library, with the database being hosted by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

A website that lists leaderboards, command guide etc. will be implemented in the near future.

Disclaimer - This Discord bot project was started as a project to learn JavaScript and programming in general, so be wary of questionable code. Refactoring may occur in the future.

## Setup of the bot
